# Email-Spam-Classification--Self-Project
# Email Spam Detection
The project attempts to familiarize people with classification problems in Machine Learning and the various ML algorithms used to tackle them depending upon the problem at hand and the user's needs.

## Learning Objectives
1. Basic EDA using tSNE to visualize high dimensional data and understanding its limitations.
2. General idea of the usage of data pre-processing to process raw data into a feature vector as an input to the ML model
3. ML practices such as training, cross validation and hyperparameter tuning, analysis of model fit and analysis of the best metrics to be used for model evaluation (especially in case of imbalanced data.)
4. Implementation of well-known classification algorithms on an e-mail spam detection task (viz. Logistic Regression, SVMs, Ensemble Methods etc.)
5. If time permits, a from scratch implementation of Logistic Regression, Basic Bagging and Neural Networks.
